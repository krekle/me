This task involves domain expertise, as subway cars must be inspected based on various maintenance needs that can be due to both time elapsed and miles driven. For economic reasons, it's desirable to maximize the number of kilometers a car can drive before inspection, as unused kilometers represent significant costs over the car's lifespan. This is a challenging task due to the complex combination of factors affecting a car's condition, including route choice, parking structure, unforeseen maintenance, and cleaning. The project called IVO (Individual Management of the Train Fleet) was initiated to explore the possibility of developing digital tools to optimize the planning of inspections and the management of subway cars.

For the login to be remembered, the application required the mobile to be locked with a password or pin. If not, the application required a login for each use. The application was a 'proof of concept' used to demonstrate the security behind such a solution. The concept was later used in the development of the AltInn app."
